# Microservice-application

This is a Microservices application I deployed which is an Online Boutique. It is a cloud-native microservices demo application. The Online Boutique consists of 10 services - microservices application. The application is a web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.


**ASK THIS QUESTION TO DEVELOPERS BEFORE DEPLOYING**
